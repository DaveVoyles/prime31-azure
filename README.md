### Objective

For some time now, prime[31] has been an industry leader in platform specific extensions for Unity games. Many of these extensions allow developers to tie their Unity games with the native functionality of a platform. In the case of Windows 8 and Windows Phone, they include services such as the Microsoft Advertising SDK, Social network sharing, trials and in-app purchases, and of course Azure, which this tutorial will cover.

By the end of this lab you will be able to:
